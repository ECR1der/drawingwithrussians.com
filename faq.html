        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <div class="question">What is Drawing with Russians?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing with Russians is a non-instructed figure drawing salon loosely affiliated with Russian speakers, followed by an after-party.</div>

        <div class="question">When is Drawing with Russians?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing with Russians is on the first Thursday of every month, except when otherwise.</div>

        <div class="question">Why is this event called "Drawing with Russians"?</div>
        <div class="answer">The host coined the name in 2015 while attending a figure drawing gathering almost exclusively composed of Russian speakers, and organized by another Russian-speaking artist.</div>

        <div class="question">Why didn't you rename the event after the invasion of Ukraine in 2022?</div>
        <div class="answer">The war in Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ is a tragedy and we stand with the people of Ukraine. Russia has gifted the world tremendous art and culture, along with its share of monsters, brought to power with the hands of its very people. We can't hide the truth
            by changing our name.</div>

        <div class="question">When is the next drawing?</div>

        <div class="question">Can I come to Drawing with Russians even though I am not Russian?</div>

        <div class="question">I am a terrible n00b at drawing. Should I still come?</div>

        <div class="answer">No, you must draw.</div>

        <div class="question">Do I need to be vaccinated against COVID-19?</div>
        <div class="answer">We won't check. That said, if you aren't vaccinated you either have a medical reason, or are out of your mind.</div>

        <div class="question">Will I have to wear a mask during drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">No, you will not need to wear a mask, and expect most people to not be wearing one. The building does require wearing a mask in common areas, including the elevator.</div>

        <div class="question">Where is drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing is in Hudson Yards, Manhattan, New York, at the organizer's home and art studio. Invitations include all the location details.</div>

        <div class="question">How much does drawing cost?</div>
        <div class="answer">We suggest a $20 donation directly to the model. If a lot of people show up, we put some of the money towards alcohol.</div>

        <div class="question">How many people do usually come to drawing?</div>
        <div class="answer">We have had the pleasure of hosting 10-25 people. Typically, half stay for the after-party.</div>

        <div class="question">How can I pay?</div>

        <div class="question">Should I also bring alcohol?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, you should bring a bottle of something. In Russia we never go to a house empty-handed. We enjoy socializing during breaks, and drawing is followed by an after-party. We'd rather give all the money to the model, too, and not spend it on booze.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I bring a friend?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, and tell them to bring a bottle of wine.</div>

        <div class="question">I'm an art or particle physics student in New York. Will I run into one of my professors?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing with Russians does not grade on attendance, and thus cannot guarantee it.</div>

        <div class="question">Is this a "drink and draw"?</div>
        <div class="answer">It certainly looks like one, but we don't like that name.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there music?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes, we generally play meditative Russian electronic music via SoundCloud, and an occasional <a href="https://soundcloud.com/omich1920/vd6bhjcnlcmr">classic from the 90s</a>.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I still come if I'm late?</div>
        <div class="answer">Yes you can. No need to warn us. Please walk in quietly, and wait for a break to setup.</div>

        <div class="answer">The loft has bright lights, 10 windows, and a largely unobstructed view of the Empire State building, including from the bathtub.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there food?</div>
        <div class="answer">Absolutely not. This is Drawing with Russians in Manhattan, not a buffet show at Tatiana in Brighton Beach.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I bring food?</div>
        <div class="answer">We'd rather you not. You could order pizza for everyone after drawing if you really want to.</div>

        <div class="answer">Unlike Russia, there's a grocery store across the street, and a deli within half a block in both directions. If you go to the grocery store, please ask whether the person standing in line in front of you likes to draw.</div>

        <div class="question">Is there a place to smoke?</div>
        <div class="answer">The building is non-smoking, including the roof. You'll need to take cigarettes downstairs.</div>

        <div class="answer">Yes, however you may find it lacks similar privacy features compared to typical bathrooms.</div>

        <div class="question">Can I just come to the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">We really insist that you please come to drawing, first.</div>

        <div class="question">What happens at the after-party?</div>
        <div class="answer">Drawing is followed by a typical Manhattan loft party. That said, please be aware that we usually gather a crowd that is a lot more bohemian and open-minded than at a typical loft party. ðŸ˜ˆ</div>
